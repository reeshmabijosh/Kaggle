The WiDS Datathon 2021 focuses on patient health, with an emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes, through data from MIT’s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative.

Getting a rapid understanding of the context of a patient’s overall health has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare workers around the world struggle with hospitals overloaded by patients in critical condition. Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.
Knowledge about chronic conditions such as diabetes can inform clinical decisions about patient care and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
